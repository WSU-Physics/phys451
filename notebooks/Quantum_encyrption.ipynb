    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography is typically done by the sender scrambling a communication in some way and the receiver knowing how to unscramble it. Let's say Alice wants Bob to send her his super secret chili recipe. Alice will make up some scheme for scrambling/unscrambling the data. She will send Bob instructions for doing the scrambling while only she knows how to unscramble it. The asymmetry here is very important -- even though Bob knows how to scramble the data, he (nor anyone else but Alice) should know how to unscramble it. The scrambling instructions are known as a *public key* and Alice's secret unscrambling instructions are the *private key*. The overall strategy I've described here is called *public key cryptography*.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA is a public key cryptography algorithm commonly used for encryption over the internet. Under RSA, the public key is a product of two prime numbers, $d=p\\cdot q$. Then, when Bob goes to encrypt his message, $x$, (which is really a number because that's how computers think of data), he will perform a modular operation $y=x^e\\%d$. He will then send his encrypted number, $y$, to Alice. Alice knows the prime numbers that went into the public key, and she is able to calculate a \"magic number,\" $m$ which will undo the operation that Bob performed, $x=y^m\\%d$.\n",
    "I certainly have not proven that this works, nor have I explained how to find $m$. [This computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD72Ry60eP4) goes into much more detail. But the main point is that anyone can know the public key, $d$, but only Alice, who knows the prime number $p$ and $q$ can decrypt the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be noticing the vulnerability here. If someone were to figure out $p$ and $q$, they can intercept the message and learn Bob's secret chili recipe. The solution here, so far, is to use very very large numbers (on order 300 digits per prime number). In fact, if you watch the video above, you can learn how to actually see the numbers your computer is using for encryption. But as computers get faster, they can factor larger numbers faster. So we use even larger numbers. It's a bit of a race. It becomes an even more significant problem when you realize a bad actor doesn't need to decrypt your message *now*. In principle, they can store public keys and messages for years until computer power catches up and decrypt later. Depending on the nature of the information, this could be a real issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter **quantum computers**. In a bit of irony, quantum computers will accelerate the problem and provide a very robust solution. First the accelerated problem. Shor's algorithm was developed in 1994, which shows that quantum computers (computers that \"think\" using non-binary \"qubits\" rather than the traditional 1's and 0's) will be able to factor very large numbers much faster. With quantum computers the problem reduces to polynomial time, rather than sub-exponential time for classical computing. So once quantum computing technology has developed to the point that they can hold and manipulate many qubits, RSA will essentially be obsolete.\n",
    "\n",
    "But **quantum cryptography** offers a method to send a secret key with a guarantee that no one saw it in transmission. This is certainly one of those quantum mechanical ideas that makes you say \"huh? how's that possible?\" Let's dig into it."

The next step is they call each other up and compare the *axes* that they measured - **NOT** the results.

This demo was using only a small number of states, but with sufficient numbers they can create a sequence to encrypt and decrypt the data that only they know.</font>\n",

    "How do we know that no one intercepted the key? Well, if Steven the spy were to measure the states in between, he will alter them. Any instance where Steven uses a different axis than Alice did, he will collapse the electrons wavefunction to the wrong axis, which means even if Bob measures the same axis as Alice, he has a 50-50 chance of getting the wrong state. They won't actually know that something went wrong until Bob tries to send a test message, but when it arrives scrambled by the wrong key, they will know their key is broken."
